4. API (Application Programmable Interface)
	- API is the communication medium between any two entites. Backend-Frontend, backend-mobile application, backend-backend etc.


5. What will we create SPA or SSR?
=> First we will create SSR applications.
=> Then we will learn to create APIs for SPA applications
=> Then we will do a final project is SSR model.
=> Then you may submit APIs for that project.



6. Let's create a Django Project
	=> Create a virtual environment and activate the environment
	=> pip install django
	=> django-admin startproject <project_name>
	=> cd <project_name>
	=> python manage.py runserver


7. Django follows MVT Architecture
    What is MVC (Model View Controller) architecture?
        - In MVC architecture we write table models in Model, HTML/CSS/JS in View and functions/logic
        in the controller. Laravel, .net etc. follows MVC arch.
        - In contrast, we write table models in Model, HTML/CSS/JS in Template and functions/logic in
        the MVT architecture. Django follows MVT arch.
